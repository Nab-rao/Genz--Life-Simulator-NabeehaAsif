VERSION CONTROL
Version control is a tool that keeps a history of your project so you can go back to any previous version anytime.
Imagine writing an assignment:

Version 1: introduction

Version 2: added examples

Version 3: corrected mistakes

Version 4: final draft

If you mess up in Version 4…
➡️ You can go back to Version 3.

Version control systems automatically save these versions for you.
Google Docs track changes → you can go back to an older version.
Version control does the same for code.
